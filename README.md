# JavascriptClassCreator
Web-based Javascript Class Creator that
* allows Object Oriented JS Classes,
* supporting Inheritage of Classes,
* stores the Classes in Browser's LocalStorage and
* exports the Classes in JSON Files
The code is stored in the docs/ folder, because the settings of the repository for gh-pages are defined to use the index.html file in /docs to be launched when you call the JavascriptClassCreator with the URL
* https://niebert.github.com/JavascriptClassCreator
All the repositories in "niebert" are mainly designed for rapid prototyping, exploring features or as demos for a final sound implementation.

## ToDo
* implement createNewMethodJS() in jsondb.js  which adds a new method definition to tMethods
* updating an Attribute does not work in saveAttribJSON() call without parameters in jsondb.js:94
