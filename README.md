# JavascriptClassCreator

## Introduction
Web-based Javascript Class Creator that
* allows Object Oriented JS Classes, which is not concept (i.e. OOP) JavaScript was originally designed for.
* supporting [Inheritage](http://phrogz.net/js/classes/OOPinJS2.html) of Classes by using [functions as conctructors](https://www.phpied.com/3-ways-to-define-a-javascript-class/) for classes in ways:
    1) **Defining Methods internally:** allows dynamic replacement of methods during runtime for single instances, but is more memory and time consuming, because internal methods are recreated every time you create a new object of the class.
    2) **Methods added to the prototype:** defines the methods for a class once for all created instances/objects. This is the recommended way to create Javascript classes, the more flexible approach for dynamic assignment for methods is rarely used.
* stores the Classes in Browser's LocalStorage and
* exports the Classes in JSON Files
The code is stored in the docs/ folder, because the settings of the repository for gh-pages are defined to use the index.html file in /docs to be launched when you call the JavascriptClassCreator with the URL
* https://niebert.github.com/JavascriptClassCreator
All the repositories in "niebert" are mainly designed for rapid prototyping, exploring features or as demos for a final sound implementation.

## UML Diagrams ##
JavascriptClassCreator facilitates the export of UML-diagrams with the libraries of the OpenSource [JointJS](https://github.com/clientIO/joint) repository:
* **Attributes of Classes:** UML editing of Attrubutes of Classes
* **Methods of Classes:** UML editing of Attrubutes of Classes
* **Inheritance from Classes:** JSCC allows to edit the SuperClass of Classes, visualized in UML-diagram.
* **Associations** between objects (Associations can be created and destroy during runtime)
* **Aggregation** of child instances/objects by a parent instance/object
* **Interfaces** allows inheritance the method headers that determine the call of methods. This is implemented in the JavascriptClassCreator (JSCC), but not in the Javascript itsself. When you determine a class of the type *Interface*, that JSCC checks if all method headers (i.e. the way a method will be called with parameters) are properly defined and existing. If not, JSCC will create the method header for you without creating a link for inheritance in Javascript. Attributes of the interface class are available in class as well.
* **Abstract** In contrast to an Interface an abstract class has real defined bodies of methods that can be inherited. For those methods that do not contain a body (i.e. MethodCode is empty) the method code is handle like methods defined in an interface. This means that JSCC creates method header for you by inheritance from the abstract class, that will overwritten/defined in the child class.

## Compressing Code ##
You might know from other implementation of JavaScript repositories, that there are existing two versions of the JavaScript implementation.
1) the minimise/compressed code for higher performance in web browsers and NodeJS,
2) documented code for further software development and comprehension of the previous development by new members of a team

UglifyJS is used for compressing the code and generate higher performance for the web-applications. The Developer [Mihai Bazon](http://lisperator.net/) created UglifyJS, that has even the option to parse Javascript Code, which is necessary to create equivalent minified the Javascript code (see [Source Code of UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2))). JSCC uses  mainly the wrapper for UglifyJS is written [Dan Wolff](http://danwolff.se/). His UglifyJS-Online example is called in a seperate window to minify/compress the exported Javascript code for generated JS Classes. The original version of his [UglifyJS-Wrapper](https://skalman.github.io/UglifyJS-online/) can be accessed and forked at [GitHub](https://github.com/Skalman/UglifyJS-online).

Future application of UglifyJS will allow cross compilation of generation of generic XML-Code for code generation that is highly independent of a specific programming language (see [XML2Code]https://github.com/niebert/XML2Code) as a proposal). UglifyJS can take Javascript code as input and create an [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) (AST). When the [AST in UglifyJS](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/ast) is generated, you can send a [AST walker](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/walk) over all nodes of the abstract syntax tree and perform a [Cross Compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compiler) from Javascript for example to PHP. For the code compressor in UglifyJS the AST is e.g. used to replace <tt>var vMyLongVariable = 0</tt> by <tt>var v=0</tt>. The walker for the code compressor reduces (among other tasks) the length of variable name. This makes the code less readable for developers, but creates less loading for web browsers. For JSCC the removal of comments has the highest impact on the size of the code.

## Status of software
### Releas Status
Software in currently in Beta-Testing

### ToDo
* UglifyJS can parse the syntactic structure of Javascript code. Parsing Javascript code and export to other languages (Python, C, Java, PHP, ...). UglifyJS can be used for to crosscompilation of Javascript Classes in other programming languages. Use the tree walker over the [AST Abstract Syntax Tree](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/ast).
* implement createNewPageType() in jsondb.js  which adds a new PageType definition
* Integrate UglifyJS for the generated Javascript Classes for exporting to Code2XML with AST and TreeWalker
* BUG: createButtonSelect() is not implemented, Buttons need an empty first entry
* BUG: When PageType is selected Buttons are not set and Save does not read the settings of Buttons
* BUG: Update Method Selector
* IMPROVE: add blank selection option to DB selector
* IMPROVE: remove JSON Code Generator from init in <tt>index.html</tt>
* IMPROVE: Aggregate all libs into one file and send after aggregation to the code compressor, that improves the percentage of compression a bit (low priority, because aggregation of compressed files into a single has a higher impact on loading time than the compression of the aggregated single file of all classes)


## Acknowledgement
Special thanks to:
* Developer [Mihai Bazon](http://lisperator.net/) create UglifyJS, a great tool to handle and parse Javascript Code and minify the Javascript code (see [Source Code of UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2)).
* The wrapper for UglifyJS is written [Dan Wolff](http://danwolff.se/). His UglifyJS-Online example is used to minify/compress the exported Javascript code of generated JS Classes (For Online Example of the [UglifyJS-Wrapper](https://skalman.github.io/UglifyJS-online/) see source code on https://github.com/Skalman/UglifyJS-online for the Online-Version of the Wrapper.
